What was used for this project:
-Node
-Inquirer
-mySQL

Struggles:

This homework make me cry!
As always, I am struggling a lot with JavaScript. I found mySQL very difficult to work with and hard to understand. Because the past assignment have all used Inquirer, I found it a little easier to use because I was more familiar with it. Even though I got the inquirer questions going on my own, I needed a lot of  help understanding the formatting and the usage of it for this assignment.
